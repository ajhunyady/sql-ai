# Agent Creation Tabs Guide

This guide walks you through each tab in the agent workspace so you can configure a new agent step by step.

Click **Create New Agent** to launch a step-by-step wizard that presents each configuration screen. After finishing, you'll be taken to the agent workspace.

## Metadata
Provide the agent name, a short description, and select the dataset type that the agent will work with.

## Data Integrations
Configure the data store connection (e.g., type, host, port, credentials). Add or reuse tools to allow the agent to interact with the data.

## LLM Config
Manage provider credentials and choose the large language model your agent will use. You can create new credentials or reuse existing ones.

## Querying Guidance
Assemble guidance modules such as rules, examples, and constraints. The modules are compiled into a system prompt that steers the agent's behavior.

## Testing
Send prompts to the agent and review the simulated responses. Toggle comparison mode and inspect execution logs.

## Evaluations
Create test cases with prompts and expected outputs. Run all test cases to see pass or fail results.

## Monitoring
Review dashboard placeholders for usage and error charts, alerts, and a log table. Refresh logs as needed.

## Settings
Access agent settings, including the ability to delete the agent.
